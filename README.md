# collective_behaviour
The main goal of our work is to write an algorithm that will solve the following problem: given a set of N sheep represented as a point in the plan , we have to regroup all of them in a given area with one or several sheepdogs. In our case, we will focus on using only one sheepdog. This problem is tackled by the article of Lui Y. And collaborators. They managed to develop a completely functional algorithm that perfectly replicates the collective behaviour of a sheep herd. We have tried to implement this algorithm in Python and run some simulations with different parameters and discuss the obtained results.
