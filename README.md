# collective_behaviour
The main goal of our work is to write an algorithm that will solve the following problem: given a set of N sheep represented as a point in the plan , we have to regroup all of them in a given area with one or several sheepdogs. In our case, we will focus on using only one sheepdog. This problem is tackled by the article of Lui Y. And collaborators. They managed to develop a completely functional algorithm that perfectly replicates the collective behaviour of a sheep herd. We have tried to implement this algorithm in Python and run some simulations. At the end, our sheep dog can regroup in the barn a little herd which is already grouped. When the herd is bigger or dispersed, the sheep dog does not succeed to achieve the goal.

How to run simulation:
- Download the folder classes
- Run the file main.py, a window of the simulation will open
- Add the barn, the sheep and the sheep dog by clicking on the icone and then clicking where you want to add it
- Click on "Run the simulation"
